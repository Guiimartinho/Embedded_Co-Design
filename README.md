Embedded_Co-Design
==================

This repository is here to give my project code to anyone that is interested.  Please go to the www.Sparkypedia.com to see all of my work in video form.

The code that I have uploaded so far only shows how to run SPI coms between a PIC in master mode and a PIC in slave mode. Hence the two folders, each one contains a project file and all of the source code required for operation.

Regards,

Sparkypedia!
